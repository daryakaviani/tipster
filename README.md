# Project 1 - Tipster

Tipster is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Darya Kaviani

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Slider functionality to indicate meal quality (just for fun)!
- [x] Revamped UI, color scheme, fonts, layout, etc.

## Notes

While I did get the first half of the Settings functionality to work, I ran into trouble redirecting the toggle data to reflect on the home screen default tip percentage.
